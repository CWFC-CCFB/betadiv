Description: Implement the multiple-site dissimilarity indices of Simpson, Sorensen 
    and nestedness, which can be used to assess the beta diversity of a population. 
    These indices were adapted from those developed by Baselga (2010, Global Ecology 
    and Biogeography 19:134--143) in order to make them population size-independent. 
    All the details behind the calculation and estimation of these adapted indices
    can be found in Fortin et al. (2020, Global Ecology and Biogeography 29: 1073-1084).
