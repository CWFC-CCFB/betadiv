Title: Multiple-site indices and estimators for the assessment of beta diversity 
Version: 1.0.0
Author: Mathieu Fortin
Maintainer: Mathieu Fortin <mathieu.fortin.re@gmail.com>
Description: Implement some multiple-site dissimilarity indices that can be used to assess the beta diversity in 
   a population. The multiple-site version of the indices of Simpson, Sorensen and nestedness are available in this 
   package. These indices were adapted from those developed by Baselga (2010, Global Ecology and Biogeography 19:134-143)
   in order to make them population size-independent. All the details behind the calculation and estimation of these 
   adapted indices can be found in Fortin et al. (2020, Global Ecology and Biogeography 29: 1073-1084).
