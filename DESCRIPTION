Description: Implement the multiple-site dissimilarity indices of Simpson, Sorensen 
    and nestedness, which can be used to assess the beta diversity of a population. 
    These indices were adapted from those developed by Baselga (2010) 
    <doi:10.1111/j.1466-8238.2009.00490.x> in order to have them population 
    size-independent. All the details behind the calculation and estimation of 
    these adapted indices can be found in Fortin et al. (2020) <doi:10.1111/geb.13080>.
